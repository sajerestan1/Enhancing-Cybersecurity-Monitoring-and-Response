## Overview
As part of my continuous professional development in cybersecurity, I embarked on a project focused on Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. This project involved completing the 'Introduction to SIEM' module on TryHackMe, where I gained in-depth knowledge of SIEM concepts, network visibility, log sources, and the analysis of logs and alerts. The primary objective of this project was to understand how SIEM systems contribute to an organization's ability to detect, monitor, and respond to security events in real time.

### Project Objectives

Understand SIEM Fundamentals: Explore the core components and functionalities of SIEM systems.
Enhance Network Visibility: Learn how SIEM systems provide visibility into network activities and potential threats.
Analyze Log Sources: Identify and analyze various log sources that contribute to SIEM's effectiveness.
Develop Log Analysis Skills: Gain practical experience in analyzing logs and alerts generated by SIEM systems.
Apply SIEM Capabilities: Understand how SIEM systems can be leveraged to protect networks and sensitive data from potential threats.

### SIEM Fundamentals

The project began with an exploration of SIEM's role in modern cybersecurity. I learned that SIEM systems are designed to aggregate and analyze data from multiple sources within an organization's IT infrastructure. This aggregation allows for real-time monitoring and alerting on potential security incidents. Key SIEM components include data collection, normalization, correlation, and reporting.

### Network Visibility
One of the primary benefits of SIEM is its ability to provide comprehensive visibility into network activities. During the project, I explored how SIEM systems collect data from various network devices, servers, and endpoints. This data is then correlated to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate malicious activities. By analyzing network traffic and system logs, I gained insights into how SIEM enhances situational awareness and aids in early threat detection.

### Log Sources and Analysis
The effectiveness of a SIEM system heavily relies on the quality and variety of log sources it collects. I identified and analyzed several log sources, including firewall logs, intrusion detection system (IDS) logs, and application logs. Each log source provided valuable information that, when correlated, helped build a more comprehensive security posture. The project emphasized the importance of ensuring that log sources are correctly configured and regularly monitored to maximize the effectiveness of the SIEM.

### Lab Work
As part of the hands-on experience, I engaged in a static lab where I interacted with a sample SIEM dashboard displaying various events. The lab provided practical insights into how SIEM systems trigger alerts when suspicious activities are detected. Below are the tasks completed during the lab:

### Identifying the Suspicious Process:

After clicking on "Start Suspicious Activity," I identified that the process cudominer.exe caused the alert.


### Determining the Responsible User:

The user responsible for executing the suspicious process was chris.fort.

### Finding the Hostname:

The hostname of the suspect user was HR_02.
Examining the Rule and Process: The rule that triggered the alert was matched by the term miner.

### Classifying the Event:

Based on the analysis, the event was classified as a True-Positive.

These exercises allowed me to apply SIEM concepts in a simulated environment, reinforcing my understanding of how alerts are generated and investigated within a SIEM framework.

### Log and Alert Analysis

A significant portion of the project involved hands-on experience with log and alert analysis. I utilized the TryHackMe platform to simulate real-world scenarios where I analyzed logs to detect potential security incidents. This practical experience was invaluable in understanding how SIEM systems can help security teams quickly identify and respond to threats. I learned to differentiate between false positives and actual threats, which is critical in minimizing alert fatigue and ensuring that genuine incidents are addressed promptly.

### SIEM Capabilities

The project concluded with an exploration of the broader capabilities of SIEM systems. I discovered how SIEM can be integrated with other security tools and technologies, such as threat intelligence platforms and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, to create a more robust security ecosystem. Additionally, I learned how SIEM systems support compliance efforts by generating reports that meet regulatory requirements.

## Conclusion
This project significantly enhanced my understanding of SIEM systems and their role in cybersecurity. By completing the 'Introduction to SIEM' module on TryHackMe, I developed practical skills in log analysis, network visibility, and incident detection. The knowledge and experience gained from this project have prepared me to contribute effectively to security operations teams, particularly in roles that require the monitoring and analysis of security events. As I continue to build my cybersecurity portfolio, this project serves as a testament to my commitment to learning and my ability to apply SIEM concepts in real-world scenarios.
